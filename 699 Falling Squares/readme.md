# 699. Falling Squares

On an infinite number line (x-axis), we drop given squares in the order they are given.

The i-th square dropped (positions[i] = (left, side_length)) is a square with the left-most point being positions[i][0] and sidelength positions[i][1].

The square is dropped with the bottom edge parallel to the number line, and from a higher height than all currently landed squares. We wait for each square to stick before dropping the next.

The squares are infinitely sticky on their bottom edge, and will remain fixed to any positive length surface they touch (either the number line or another square). Squares dropped adjacent to each other will not stick together prematurely.


Return a list ans of heights. Each height ans[i] represents the current highest height of any square we have dropped, after dropping squares represented by positions[0], positions[1], ..., positions[i].

### Solution:

This is another interval problem which little diffence form the before one. The new interval will have a total length n+k. There are a lot of ways to solve this problem, most easily one is to find all the interval overlop with this one and get most length. O(n^2).
