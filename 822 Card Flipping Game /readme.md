# 822. Card Flipping Game

On a table are N cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different).

We flip any number of cards, and after we choose one card. 

If the number X on the back of the chosen card is not on the front of any card, then this number X is good.

What is the smallest number that is good?  If no number is good, output 0.

Here, fronts[i] and backs[i] represent the number on the front and back of card i. 

A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa.

### Example:

**Input:** fronts = [1,2,4,4,7], backs = [1,3,4,1,3]
Output: 2

**Explanation:** If we flip the second card, the fronts are [1,3,4,4,7] and the backs are [1,2,4,1,3].

We choose the second card, which has number 2 on the back, and it isn't on the front of any card, so 2 is good.


### Note:

1. 1 <= fronts.length == backs.length <= 1000.
2. 1 <= fronts[i] <= 2000.
3. 1 <= backs[i] <= 2000.

## Solution:

This is really a strange problem. The problem is really not hard if you understand the meaningï¼š only those card with same in the back and front can't choose as the number X, we just find the min value in all the number not in these range.

```
    public int flipgame(int[] fronts, int[] backs)
    {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<Integer>();
        for(int i = 0; i < fronts.length; i++)
        {
            if(fronts[i] == backs[i]) set.add(fronts[i]);
        }
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i = 0; i < fronts.length; i++)
        {
            if(!set.contains(fronts[i])) res = Math.min(res, fronts[i]);
            if(!set.contains(backs[i])) res = Math.min(res, backs[i]);
        }
        if(res == Integer.MAX_VALUE) return 0;
        return res;
    }
```
