# 458. Poor Pigs

### Solution

We should regard this problem as a different problem we meet before.

Firstly we think if we have 2 pigs and 4 turns, how many buckets we can test?

1 pig can detect 5 buckets, the next pig can regard as row index base the the column index of the first pig

we can total get 25 pigs. 

The answer is really easy base on this thought.
