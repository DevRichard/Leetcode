#666. Path Sum IV

If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by a list of three-digits integers.

For each integer in this list:
The hundreds digit represents the depth D of this node, 1 <= D <= 4.
The tens digit represents the position P of this node in the level it belongs to, 1 <= P <= 8. The position is the same as that in a full binary tree.
The units digit represents the value V of this node, 0 <= V <= 9.
Given a list of ascending three-digits integers representing a binary with the depth smaller than 5. You need to return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

### Solution:

This is not a hard but also very complex problem. We should use the index to simulate the operation of tree and get the path sum.
