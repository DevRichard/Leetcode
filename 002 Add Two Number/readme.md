# 002 Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example
>Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
>
>Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

### Solution
这道题没有什么技术含量，只要注意一下链表长度不一和最后一位进位这两种特殊情况就可以的
